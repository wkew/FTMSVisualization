Aspects based on 
Seven Golden Rules - doi:  10.1186/1471-2105-8-105

This tool will generate a list of all possible chemical ***IONIC*** formulae within specific constraints, notably:
    High and low mass limits
    Elemental (CHNOS Na K) limits
    Ionisation mode limits
    Seven golden rules, see above

The output are a series of csv files which contain lists of formulae and their exact masses. 
The formulae correspond to singly charged ionic species.
These may be protonated, sodium or potassium adducts (positive mode)
Or deprotonated (negative mode).

The generated lists can be used for:
    a) determining an appropriate error of assignment threshold at a given m/z
    b) automated assignment of peaklists

Changelog below
#####
The script defines two functions firstly - getmass and getabun. 
These are used to calculate the exact mass of a given formula & its percentage probability based on existing based on the natural abundance of the constituent isotopes.
So a compound of exactly 1 Carbon-12 will have a 98.9% probability, despite obviously not existing as a "real" molecule, and something C100 would be 33% (98.9% ^ 100)

Version 4 corrects to add the exact mass of an electron - taken from NIST.
The mass of this electron should *removed* from the final mass for a positive mode compound.
OR *added* to the final mass for a negative mode compound. 
Prior to this version, the calculator was producing neutral mass compounds. 

Version 4 is also more strict on elemental ratios (rules 4-6 from Seven Golden Rules, taking the "99.7% common range" rules.)

Version 5 
Adds ability to switch between negative and positive modes. 
Formula constraints tightened for what is known in Scotch Whisky (Negative ESI only shows CHOS, and max S1).
May need adjusting for other ionisation sources and modes. 
Negative mode formula must now have an odd number of protons - this means they have been ionised by loss of a proton. Radicals, etc, will not be determined. 
#####
Version 6 - September 2020
Add support for P for Positive mode - fix broken code.
