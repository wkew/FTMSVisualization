This script will read in a CSV of assigned formulae from a mass spectrum and plot a variety of scatter and hexbin plots.
This uses the matplotlib backend.
Examples include Van Krevelens and DBE vs C# plots, but the script is flexible to any 2D scatter plot.
The plots also encode colour and size, allowing up to four dimensions of information to be visualised on a single figure.

The script should be fairly self-evident how to customise to your tastes.
An example input file is included with this distribution - your input files must have the same format.

The script will ask you to confirm file locations, and then if you want titles, and if you want hexbin output as well as normal output. 

This tool was used in our recent paper on Scotch Whisky - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-016-1513-y
